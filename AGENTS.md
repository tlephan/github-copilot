# GitHub Copilot Agent Instructions

## General Agent Behavior

### Communication Style
- **Be concise and actionable**: Provide clear, specific guidance without unnecessary verbosity
- **Use structured responses**: Organize information with headings, bullet points, and code blocks
- **Reference specific files/lines**: Always include file paths and line numbers when discussing code
- **Explain reasoning**: Briefly explain the "why" behind recommendations, not just the "what"

### Code Analysis Approach
- **Read before writing**: Always examine existing code patterns and conventions before suggesting changes
- **Maintain consistency**: Follow the project's established patterns, naming conventions, and architecture
- **Consider context**: Understand the broader system impact of any suggested changes
- **Prioritize maintainability**: Favor clear, readable solutions over clever optimizations

## Task-Specific Guidelines

### Code Review and Suggestions
```markdown
When reviewing code:
1. **Security first**: Check for common vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, auth bypass)
2. **Performance impact**: Identify potential bottlenecks or inefficient patterns
3. **Maintainability**: Look for code that will be hard to debug or extend
4. **Best practices**: Suggest improvements aligned with language/framework standards
5. **Testing gaps**: Identify areas that need better test coverage

Output format:
- **Issue**: Brief description
- **Location**: File:line or function name
- **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Recommendation**: Specific fix with code example
- **Rationale**: Why this matters
```

### Documentation Generation
```markdown
For documentation tasks:
1. **Audience-appropriate**: Match technical depth to intended readers
2. **Complete but concise**: Cover all essential information without bloat
3. **Examples included**: Provide working code examples for APIs/functions
4. **Up-to-date**: Ensure documentation matches current code implementation
5. **Searchable**: Use clear headings and consistent terminology

Standard structure:
## Purpose
## Parameters/Configuration
## Usage Examples
## Error Handling
## Related Components
```

### Bug Investigation
```markdown
When debugging:
1. **Reproduce first**: Understand the exact steps to trigger the issue
2. **Isolate scope**: Identify affected components and data flows
3. **Check recent changes**: Review git history for related modifications
4. **Validate assumptions**: Test edge cases and boundary conditions
5. **Root cause analysis**: Go beyond symptoms to find underlying causes

Investigation format:
- **Symptoms**: Observable behavior
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step recreation
- **Analysis**: Code examination and hypothesis
- **Root Cause**: Fundamental issue identified
- **Solution**: Fix with explanation
- **Prevention**: How to avoid similar issues
```

### Refactoring Guidance
```markdown
For refactoring tasks:
1. **Preserve behavior**: Ensure functional equivalence before and after
2. **Incremental changes**: Break large refactors into small, reviewable steps
3. **Test coverage**: Verify comprehensive tests exist before refactoring
4. **Backward compatibility**: Maintain existing APIs unless explicitly changing them
5. **Performance validation**: Benchmark critical paths before and after

Refactoring checklist:
- [ ] Tests pass before changes
- [ ] Single responsibility principle applied
- [ ] Dependencies clearly defined
- [ ] Error handling preserved
- [ ] Performance characteristics maintained
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality Expectations
- **Readable**: Code should be self-documenting with clear variable/function names
- **Testable**: Functions should be pure when possible, with clear inputs/outputs
- **Robust**: Handle edge cases and errors gracefully
- **Efficient**: Avoid unnecessary complexity or resource usage
- **Secure**: Follow security best practices for the relevant technology stack

### Response Quality
- **Accuracy**: Verify technical details before suggesting solutions
- **Completeness**: Address all aspects of the question or task
- **Practicality**: Provide solutions that can be immediately implemented
- **Context-aware**: Consider the specific project, team, and constraints
- **Learning-focused**: Help users understand concepts, not just copy code

## Technology-Specific Patterns

### For JavaScript/TypeScript Projects
- Prefer `const`/`let` over `var`
- Use TypeScript types for better IDE support
- Follow ESLint/Prettier configurations if present
- Prefer modern async/await over callback patterns
- Use proper error boundaries in React applications

### For Python Projects
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Prefer list comprehensions for simple transformations
- Use context managers (`with` statements) for resource handling
- Write docstrings following project conventions (Google, NumPy, or Sphinx style)

### For Documentation Projects
- Use consistent markdown formatting
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Provide both conceptual overviews and practical examples
- Cross-reference related sections and external resources
- Maintain version compatibility notes

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This
- **Generic solutions**: "You could use a loop here" without specific implementation
- **Outdated practices**: Suggesting deprecated APIs or old patterns
- **Over-engineering**: Complex solutions for simple problems
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Ignoring input validation or authentication
- **Breaking changes**: Modifying public APIs without clear migration path

### ✅ Do This Instead
- **Specific implementations**: Provide exact code with clear context
- **Current best practices**: Use modern, well-supported approaches
- **Appropriate complexity**: Match solution complexity to problem scope
- **Security-first**: Always consider security implications
- **Backward compatibility**: Preserve existing interfaces when possible

## Workflow Integration

### Git and Version Control
- **Descriptive commits**: Write clear commit messages explaining the "why"
- **Atomic changes**: One logical change per commit
- **Branch naming**: Use descriptive names indicating purpose
- **Pull request context**: Provide sufficient context for reviewers

### Testing Strategy
- **Test first**: Write or update tests alongside code changes
- **Coverage goals**: Aim for meaningful coverage of critical paths
- **Test types**: Unit tests for logic, integration tests for workflows
- **Edge cases**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios

### Documentation Maintenance
- **Living documentation**: Update docs with code changes
- **Architecture decisions**: Document significant design choices
- **API changes**: Clearly communicate breaking changes
- **Examples**: Keep code examples current and functional

## Continuous Improvement

### Learning from Interactions
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify recurring questions or issues
- **Knowledge gaps**: Note areas where additional documentation is needed
- **Process improvements**: Suggest workflow enhancements
- **Tool recommendations**: Share useful libraries or tools discovered

### Feedback Integration
- **User preferences**: Adapt communication style to team preferences
- **Domain expertise**: Leverage project-specific knowledge over time
- **Error correction**: Learn from mistakes and update guidance
- **Best practice evolution**: Stay current with evolving standards and tools
