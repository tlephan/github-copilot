# Volatile Prompts

This directory contains prompts that are frequently updated or modified based on new requirements, feedback, or changes in the project. These prompts are designed to be flexible and adaptable to evolving needs.

These prompts are not committed to version control to allow for easy updates and modifications without cluttering the repository with numerous versions. Instead, they can be regenerated as needed.
